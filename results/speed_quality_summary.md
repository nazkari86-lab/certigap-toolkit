## Solver Tradeoff

- `exact` is the reference solver for the measured small instances.
- `beam` is near-exact on the measured small cases, but is not faster than exact there; this benchmark does not establish a crossover point.
- `greedy` is usually faster but can be substantially worse on structured skewed tasks.
- `balanced` and `weighted` are cheap baselines, but quality is systematically weaker on skewed workloads.
